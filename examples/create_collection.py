  # There are two ways of creating a collection. The first one is using a text
  # that contains one of more IoCs. We could for example load a file for this:
  # with open('file.txt') as f:
  #   col_obj = client.create_collection_from_raw_text(args.name, f.read())

  # The other one is using a list of IoCs (file hashes, URLs, domains and IP
  # addresses). The advantage of this is that these IoCs are validated, so you
  # get an error if for example a domain is not valid or if a file hash doesn't
  # match a MD5/SHA1/SHA256 hash.

  files = []  # Your hashes here.
  urls = []  # Your URLs here.
  domains = ['hooli.com']  # Your domains here.
  ip_addresses = []  # You IP addresses here.
