	"content": " Requirements vt-py requires Python 3.5.6+, Python 2.x is not supported. This is because vt-py makes use of the new async/await syntax for implementing asynchronous coroutines. Not supporting Python 2.x was a difficult decission to make, as we are aware that Python 2.x is still popular among VirusTotal users, but in the long run we think it\u0026rsquo;s the right one. Python 2.7 has its days numbered, and the new concurrency features in included in Python 3.5+ are perfect for creating highly performant code without having to deal with multithreading or multiprocessing.\nHow to install The easiest way of installing vt-py is using pip:\npip install vt-py  "
